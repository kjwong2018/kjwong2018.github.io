        <h1> PAST PROJECT </h1>
        <p> &bull; DCAS (C++, C) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; A class project writing a simple drone simulation using mutex and threads. </p1>
        <p> &bull; XINU (C) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; A class project writing commands, task scheduling, chat and more. </p1>
        <p> &bull; MIPS (Assembly) &emsp; &emsp; &nbsp; MIPS was use to write calculator in bare mode to get us familiar with assembly. </p1>
        <p> &bull; ARM 7 (Assembly) &emsp; &emsp; A project as a team of two creating the game dig dug on a ARM microprocessor. </p1>
        <p> &bull; ALU (Verilog) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &nbsp; I wrote a 32 bit ALU that handles different opcode such as subtract, beq and more. </p1>
        <p> &bull; Gift (Flask) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; I wrote the backend that query AWS RDS and process it for the front end. (A simple UB hacking project)</p1>
